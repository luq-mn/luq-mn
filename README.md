Let's make this quick

# An Introduction to Myself

My name is **Luqman**, also addressable as **Luq**. Born and raised in Malaysia by a housewife and startup founder, tech firm chief executive. Friends call me "the next Elon Musk" or "CEO guy", which I believe sums up who I am quite well. My qualities include an exceptional level of dedication, creativity and leadership skills, exquisite craftmanship, and an approachable and friendly character. I happen to know enough things to be able to at least start a conversation with the average folk. 

| What I Do | The Interests |
|-----------|---------------|
| Programming is a big thing but not everything. I write in **JavaScript**, **Python**, **Ruby**, and some **C**. The other things I do are **drawing** (objects, buildings, landscapes), **writing** (non-fiction, lyrics and plays), some DJ-ing, **public speaking** and **track runs**. | My interests are vast, and consumes most of my free time. This includes, amongst the obvious, **programming** and **tech**, others are **science**, **economics**, **business development**, **geopolitics**, **history**, **semiconductor technologies** to list a few. |

Tons of things. Not currently in a relationship.

## The Present

| What I'm Working On | What I'm Learning |
|----------------------------|-------------------|
| [CMS](https://github.com/luqmanually/CMS) - Based on the Kaboom.js game library, it runs in your browser | Silicon packaging and CPU technologies |
| [Competence](https://github.com/luqmanually/Competence) - A Discord bot I made for fun | Quantum Computing, concepts and programming with IBM's [Qiskit](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit) |
| [Name Your Hamster](https://github.com/luqmanually/name-your-hamster) - Open world hamster game | Some Rust and C |

The things I work on and learn are diversified.

## The Future

| Near  | Far  |
|-------|------|
| Continue my pursuit in learning everything I can whilst I still have the time and ability to do so. Improve my skillset, learn more **C**, **Rust**, and a couple libraries here and there. Develop some games, things that I want to build. Practice, practice, practice. Master advanced mathematics, which I believe will be very useful in my next few years, academically and professionally. Learn more economics and business management in general. There is always room for more, improvement and achievements. | Be the valedictorian of my highschool, spend a few months travelling around the world and networking, become an undergraduate at **University of Florida**, where I plan on taking a major in *Computer Science*, and minors in *Economics* and *Statistics*. After graduating, get a job at Mckinsey and Company and stay for a few years. Either start my own companies or help run existing ones. Become a Fortune 500 CEO. Get married and have kids when the time comes. Serve god. |

Regardless, make it big.

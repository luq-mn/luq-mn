Let's make this quick

# An Introduction to Myself

My name is Luqman, also addressable as Luq. Born and raised in Malaysia by a housewife and tech entreprenuer. Friends call me "the next Elon Musk" or "CEO guy", which I believe sums up who I am. My qualities include an exceptional level of dedication and leadership skills, exquisite craftmanship, and an approachable and friendly character. I happen to know enough things to be able to at least start a conversation with the average folk.

Not currently in a relationship. I am picky.

## What I do

Some programming, I have experience building Discord bots. I would not say I am an expert, but I do have enough to at least learn something, and apply it to my projects. I also draw (mostly buildings, and objects), write (songs, letters and if necessary, plays) and craft.

Tons of things.

## The Future

I want to be the valedictorian for my high school, then make it to University of Florida to study Computer Science as my major, Economics and Statistics as my minor - and play for the football team (assuming I keep up with my exercises for the next 2-3 years). After graduating, get a job as a consultant at Mckinsey and Company, stay for a few years and when the time is right, found a company. Once I feel comfortable and have the ability to, get married and have kids. Become a Fortune 500 CEO. Make it to the billionaires list. Serve god.

Make it big.

Let's make this quick

# An Introduction to Myself

My name is **Luqman**, also addressable as **Luq**. Born and raised in Malaysia by a housewife and startup founder, tech firm chief executive. Friends call me "the next Elon Musk" or "CEO guy", which I believe sums up who I am quite well. My qualities include an exceptional level of dedication, creativity and leadership skills, exquisite craftmanship, and an approachable and friendly character. I happen to know enough things to be able to at least start a conversation with the average folk.

Not in a relationship.

## What I do, and The Interests

Programming is a big thing but not everything. I write in JavaScript, Python, Ruby, and some C. The other things I do are drawing (objects, buildings, landscapes), writing (non-fiction, lyrics and plays), some DJ-ing, public speaking and track runs.

My interests are vast, and consumes most of my time. This includes, amongst the obvious, **programming** and **tech**, others are **science**, **economics**, **business development**, **geopolitics**, **history**, **semiconductor technologies** to list a few.

Tons of things.

## The Future

In the near future, I would like to continue my pursuit in garthering knowledge across multiple fields, while specialising in **corporate/business** and **tech**. Some items in my list includes quantum computing, blockchain technology and cryptography. Programming wise, I would like to apply what I learned and gathered into projects which I hope brings benefit and some fun on the table, for me, and everyone.

I want to be the valedictorian for my high school, then make it to **University of Florida** to study **Computer Science** as my major, **Economics** and **Statistics** as my minor - and play for the football team (assuming I keep up with my exercises for the next 2-3 years). Post graduation, get a job as a consultant at Mckinsey and Company, stay for a few years and when the time is right, start a company. Once I feel comfortable and have the ability to, get married and have kids. Become a Fortune 500 CEO. Make it to the billionaires list. Serve god.

Make it big.

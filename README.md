### A little background of myself

I am currently a secondary school student, who has a passion for innovative, improving myself and tech.
Am one of those guys that others call a hacker because I use a terminal once in a while...

Prior to Summer 2023, I wasn't that active in coding - most of my focus was on school, tech, and what I call the daily
dose of news. Nowadays I skip through some dozens of big thick textbooks hoping whatever I'm reading gets inside my brain
(it works most of the time) and do some coding in my free time - though quite limited.

### Programming Languages

At 9 years old I started coding Scratch, with exposure to the Science and Robotics subject in my school. I quickly
fell in love with the idea of creating anything I'd like, then kept on trying until it worked as intended - no matter
how or why lol. Big credit to my teacher, U. Mustafa who was kind enough to be a dear friend and mentor of mine
in primary school - although he didn't teach me so much, the very basics he taught helped me become who I am.
I was quite a decent guy in the Scratch community in 2021 thanks to some cool projects I've made, quite proud of it lol.

Now in secondary school, 13-year-old me got exposed to Python - took them a while. I got the hang of it
but didn't really know what to work on, so decided to not pay it too much attention.

Currently, I work on the MÃ¥tta Discord bot (a fun project), and some other side-hustles.

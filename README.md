# A little background of myself

I am currently a secondary school student, who has a passion for innovative, improving myself and tech.
Am one of those guys that others call a hacker because I write code bruh.

Prior to Summer 2023, I wasn't that active in coding - most of my focus was on school, tech, and what I call the daily
dose of news. Nowadays I skip through some dozens of big thick textbooks hoping whatever I'm reading gets inside my brain
(it works most of the time) and do some coding in my free time - though quite limited.

# Programming languages
Python, C, Lua, some HTML + CSS and JavaScript. So far specialising in Discord Bot development, and some data things here
and there...

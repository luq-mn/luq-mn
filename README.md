# A little background of myself

I am currently a secondary school student, who has a passion for innovative, improving myself and tech.
Am one of those guys that others call a hacker because I use a terminal once in a while...

Prior to Summer 2023, I wasn't that active in coding - most of my focus was on school, tech, and what I call the daily
dose of news. Nowadays I skip through some dozens of big thick textbooks hoping whatever I'm reading gets inside my brain
(it works most of the time) and do some coding in my free time - though quite limited.

# Programming languages

Python, Lua, some Javascript and HTML, Scratch (if it counts lol)

# Plans for the future

I haven't got much planned, but if time allows me to, I would like to pursue programming more and expand
into other languages, maybe Java, C++ and C in the next year or so. Other than coding, I'll continue
pursuing my other hobbies and interests such as economics, business management, accounting and consumer tech.

# A little background of myself

I am a 15 year old Malaysian-born secondary student that enjoys writing code. My interest in coding began in grade three when my Computer Science
teacher, *Mustafa*, taught the class the basics of Scratch. Since then, I spent a bit of my free time writing code in a regular basis - despite
being raised in a very strict family.

In school, I am known for my exceptional leadership skills, creativity and dedication - also acedamic achievements. My favorite subject is
Science, and Computer Science (obviously), followed by History. Despite having excellent an acedamic track record, I am simply terrible
at Mathematics - particularly, Algebra 1 and it has set me down a bit, however, it would not stop me from continuing my pursuit of hopefully tackling it down
in the future!

Character-wise, I am very positive, somewhat charismatic, ambitious, very confident, and to a certain degree, an atheletic kind of person. Friends call me "the next Elon Musk" and "future CEO of a Fortune 500 company" - which is good, I guess? It is however part of my ambition to start companies and hopefully make a fortune out of it,
so I get to bring a larger positive impact to the world, maybe my enthusiasm and character is just contagious and "fills the room".

## My profile
Frequently, I only use **Python** and **JavaScript**. I love designing things but not developing frontend-focused applications, so I have little experience writing frontend code but I do know a bit of **HTML** and **CSS**. Most of my Python projects consists of random vanity things, and **Discord bots**.

## So, what is next?
As of 2nd February 2024, my plan is to further sharpen my programming skills by working on more projects, and learn new tools/languages such as **Rust**, **Solid.js**. Cybersecurity, Data Science and Backend Development does interest me though, and I look forward towards learning those subjects as well. 

Acedamic-wise, I will tackle Algebra 1, maybe learn Linear-Algebra too since it's essential for machine learning and quantum computing.
Otherwise, mostly business-related things like accounting, funding, stock market analysis, startup research, economics and fine-tuning of soft skills.
I have a decent idea that I think is worth taking to the next level - it is overdue for me to finally work on my startup. Looking forward towards what the future has in me!

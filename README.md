# A little background of myself

Hi, I am Luqman Yazrie - you can call me **Luq** (a nickname coined by a dear bestie of mine). Born in Malaysia in 2009, I am known for my exceptional creativity, dedication, craftsmanship and leadership skills. First introduced to the world of programming by my dear computer science teacher, *Mustafa*, back in grade 3, in love with it ever since.

Raised by a housewife (with a computer science degree) and an entreprenuerial dad (specialises in IT, networking, finance and tech in general), I grew up participating in various competitions, watching prototypes go into production, working on Excel spreadsheets, and occasionally, attending meetings.

My interests are in a wide range of fields, from consumer technology, software engineering, to finance, economics and business development. Honorable mentions include architecture and product design - if I get bored, sad or feeling down, I will grab several sheets of paper and begin drawing. Most of the things that I love to draw includes UI concepts, vehicles, buildings and man-made objects.

## My profile

The languages I use frequently are **Python**, and **JavaScript**. I am somewhat familiar with other languages too, such as **Ruby**, **C**, basic **HTML** and **CSS**. Most of the projects that I work on are more focused towards the backend rather than the frontend (UI, etc), however I am gifted with exceptional creativity hence designing user interfaces/experiences are something that I am happy to do.

Some of the projects that I have worked on includes *Discord* bots, and vanity side-projects (mostly calculators for some reason).

## So.. what is next?

As of 18th February 2024, my plan is to continue pursuit of programming - fine-tuning my skills, work on a few more projects, and to explore more of how businesses grow, economies develop and the analytics behind it. Do whatever it takes to make it to University of Florida (so I get to study with my dear bestie), then work as a start-up consultant at the US East Coast area.

Expect me to work on projects related to finance, data science and games - Roblox and Kaboom.js particularly.

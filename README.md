# A little background of myself

I am currently a secondary school student, who has a passion for innovative, improving myself and tech.
Simply said, I write code, hit run, and it works (optional).

Prior to Summer 2023, I wasn't that active in coding - most of my focus was on school, tech, and what I call the daily
dose of news. Nowadays I skip through some dozens of big thick textbooks hoping whatever I'm reading gets inside my brain
(it works most of the time) and do some coding in my free time - though quite limited.

# Programming languages
Python, C, JavaScript, some Lua, HTML + CSS and recently, Ruby. So far specialising in **Discord bot development** using pycord, random things with C and Ruby, some JavaScript projects (RESTful API),and a ton of other stuff made using Python.

## What am I learning next?
- Improve my existing skills and knowledge related to backend development using the RESTful API
- Work on my JavaScript more
- Discord.js to create more feature-rich and advanced Discord bot
- Ruby on Rails
- Flutter
